# Tailwind CSS Layout Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected layout issue when using certain Tailwind CSS classes. The text within a container is cut off, and the container itself appears smaller than expected.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simple component that uses Tailwind CSS classes. The expected behavior is for the text to be fully visible within a properly sized container. However, the actual behavior shows the text being cut off, suggesting a conflict or misinterpretation of the classes.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`. By making specific adjustments to the Tailwind CSS classes, the layout issue is resolved. The details of the fix are explained in the comments within the file.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the code using your preferred method (e.g., a web server, bundler).
4. Observe the rendering of the component in `bug.js` to see the issue.
5. Then compare it with the fixed version in `bugSolution.js`.
